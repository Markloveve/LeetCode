# LeetCode  

1.maze_path  
Problem Introduction:  
A maze runs from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, with many obstacles in the middle that cannot be passed. Now, it is necessary to calculate the sum of the number of different paths that can be passed without passing through these obstacles. Here, the combinatorial number idea is used to solve it, and the time complexity is better than the DP algorithm.
